<hr>
<h2>
Hello! My name is Dawkins Milochik and am 15 years old. I am currently a sophomore 
at the Burlington County Institute of Technology as a Computer Science student, and have been studying Computer Science 
for over a year.
</h2>
<section>
<h2>
<hr>
I would consider myself to be a problem solver, finding new 
and interesting solutions to any issues, both in and outside of working with 
computers.

<!-- Positive Qualities -->
</div>
<h2>
Though I tend to prefer to keep to myself, I can collaborate well with 
others when given the chance if the situation calls for it. I'd consider myself to 
be a very creative person, both in the technical world and out. Even with 
seemingly complex problems, I often find a simple and elegant solution.
<br>
In addition to this, I am a very flexible person when it comes to most things, 
including performing tasks and interacting with other people, which I believe may 
be beneficial to your company.

<h2>
<br>
I feel it supplemental to add that I have a fair interest in mathematics, which I 
bring up here due to the fact that there is often math involved in programming and 
web design, 
especially in systems that require a lot of numbers, from banking systems to 
calculators to video games, numbers are everywhere. Due to this knowledge, I can 
often easily determine how to put these numbers together for any purpose whatsoever, 
including how to properly use them for web development and design.
</h2>

<!-- Negative Qualities -->
<section>
<h2>
<hr class="evil">
If I had to list one negative quality or a personal weakness, I would say that I am a 
stubborn person. I prefer to do things my own way, even when presented with 
solutions that are widely considered better or more elegant.
<br>
However, this 
stubborness does grant the benefit of being able to focus on a single problem 
until I can find a solution. If I find an issue in code, to provide example, I 
will never brush it aside and will try to fix it as soon as possible and will 
not leave it be until I'm satisfied with the solution, meaning that I won't ever leave 
a bug, glitch, or formatting error alone until it is gone, making it impossible for it to 
be missed if I'm working on it.
