<!-- Skills -->
<h2 class="secondary">Skills</h2>
<h2>
I have been working with HTML and CSS for about a year and have helped create 
many web pages in that time.
</h2>
<br>
<h2>
I am knowledgable in many parts of this field, 
including knowing how to properly format text on a webpage, incorporating images 
and videos into pages, linking web pages to one another via links and other 
forms of media, and how use to CSS to tie everything together and make the website 
look appealing and easily usable.

<!-- Qualifications -->
<h2 class="secondary">Qualifications</h2>
<h2>
You can have all the skills in the world, but if you don't have the knowledge to 
properly perform your job, then there's no point in hiring somebody. Below is a 
list of qualifications I have that I believe can be useful to fill this role. These 
include but are not limited to:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Strong time management skills</li>
<li>Good at communicating with others</li>
<li>Not easily distracted and can focus on task</li>
<li>Prior experience in managing a group and improving group cooridnation and 
overall efficeincy in tasks</li>
<li>Imaginative and creative to create more interesting, simple, and or user-friendly 
web pages and sites</li>
<li>Strong knowledge in subtle parts about web design such as color theory and 
incorporating shapes to appeal to the eye</li>
</h2>
<h2 class="secondary">Prior Experience</h2>
<h2>
I have been devloping web pages and assisted others in editing their own for as long 
as I've been working with HTML and CSS. Though I have never done as such in a 
professional environment, I have never failed a request to edit the back end of 
web pages to other's specifications and desires. In times where I had not known what 
to do, I've researched what to do and often retained that information for similar 
issues in the future. I know where to go and what to search for, and how to 
incorporate what to do into my assignment, which has always ultimately led to 
success in what I needed to get done.
