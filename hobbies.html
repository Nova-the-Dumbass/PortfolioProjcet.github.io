<h1 class="main">Hobbies and Interests</h1>
<hr>
<h2>
Outside of work, I have a few hobbies that I look forward to when I get home.
Though none of them specifically relate to computer science or much of computing 
at all, I do believe they can highlight my strengths, as they can show the fact that 
I may be able to think on my feet, or plan strategically for the future, or that I 
have patience when it comes to a task that involves a lot of trial and error.
Admittedly, I also just find them fun to share and talk about.
<br>
Without further ado, 
these are my main hobbies and what I am interested in most outside of working with 
computers and technology.

<h2 class="secondary">Speedcubing</h2>
<h2>
Speedcubing is one of my favorite hobbies that I've undertaken. You may be 
somwehat familiar with the Rubik's Cube, and how the objective is to solve it 
by putting one color on each face of the cube. You may also be familiar with how 
imfamously difficult the puzzle is for many people and how it's often considered a 
thing for genuises. Truth be told, that isn't the case; most people can learn to solve one 
if given enough time and they dedicate enough practice.
</h2>

<h2>
Though a handful of people like to 
solve the cube casually, there is a large group of people, including myself who 
enjoy trying to solve the cube as fast as possible.
<br>
<br>
There are many other Rubik's 
Cube inspired puzzles that exist that people like to compete for the fastest times, 
such as the Megaminx or the Square-1.
<br>
I personally gravitate towards the classic 
3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 Rubik's cubes due to how fun they are to solve in my opinion, however 
I do enjoy other puzzles such as the Pyraminx or Square-1 from time to time, or even 
higher orders of the standard Rubik's cube, such as the 7x7 cube.
<br>
<br>
My fastest times on the 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 are 7.78 seconds, 50.31 seconds, and 2:01.47 
respectively. I practice solving the 3x3 the most by a large margin, which is why 
my personal best for it is relatively lower than that of the 4x4 and 5x5.

<br>
<h2 class="secondary">Digital Art</h2>
<h2>
Arguably my more prominent hobby of the two, I love creating digital art. I usually 
like to draw characters, so I draw them fairly often. Though I haven't been doing 
art digitally for too long, only about six months, I used to sketch on paper all the time, 
so in a way I've had a head start. Below are some of the drawings I've made, that I'd 
love to share!

purpose other than wanting to draw something that day

of curry, which he is happy to share with others!

<br>
<h2 class="secondary">Why am I sharing this?</h2>
<h2>I believe that you can learn a lot from somebody just from what they like 
to do in their spare time. They can give you a glimpse into their strengths 
and show what that person is interested in. For example, I enjoy hands-on 
experiences and enjoy strategizing and thinking on my feet, as can be seen with 
my love of speedcubing. You always need to plan ahead and think quickly to achieve 
a good time. Or, as seen in my passion for drawing, I enjoy creating and designing 
new things, and it shows the fact that I can think ahead and plan for a long-term 
project.</h2>
